                            <h2>[Full Stack Developer]</h2>
                            <p>I have completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University. Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer who specializes in creating amazing web experiences. Designing and coding have always been an interest of mine since I first began working with computers. I appreciate building websites that are well-designed, intuitive, and functional. I am also a JavaScript Developer, experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic web projects, and well-versed in numerous programming languages, including PHP with Laravel Framework, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, OOP, Bootstrap, SQL .I have a strong background in project management and customer relations. I welcome the opportunity to speak about any project type and the possibility of working together in the future. My intention at this step would be to learn new things related to my profession. As it is a technical field, one has to be updated because the technology changes often. It is my responsibility to learn and adopt the new technology. It would be profitable for me as well as for my company. And I want to set a goal and move towards that goal and want to believe in myself.</p>
