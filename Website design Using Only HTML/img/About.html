                            My name is Bivas Saha. I live in Dhaka. Recently I have completed my graduation in CSE Department from Daffodil International University. There are three members in my family. My father’s name is Babulal Saha and he is a businessman. My mother’s name is Gayatri Rani Saha and she is a housewife. My parents are very kind and loving. We all live together happily in the same house. My mother takes care of me and the other members of the family. She is always concerned about my father’s health because he has diabetes. I think Family plays an essential role in human lives. It is said that a family is like a tree. There are many branches in the tree. Similarly, in a man’s life, there are many relations in a family such as his wife, his kids, and his parents all are living together. In most families, each member has their roles and responsibilities. The father will be the head, the decision-maker, and also the supporter of the whole family. Mothers will take care of household activities and makes sure that everything is going well for everyone. And I also believe that every human is incomplete without a family. A family means to have a man, his wife, his kids, and his parents; all are living together. All the family members share equal parts while sharing the responsibilities within the family. It will make the family complete. It is believed that the family is given much importance. It is because everyone believed that a good family makes a good society. Also, a good society can make a good nation.
